# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
From a pointer to the root of a binary tree, in level order traversal, 
we visit the nodes level by level from left to right.


**Input Format:**

The first line contains an integer _n_, the number of nodes in the tree.
 
Next line contains _n_ space separated integer where _i_ integer denotes node[i].data.


**Sample Input:**

    6
    1 2 5 3 6 4

Which ara arranged in the tree as:

     1
      \
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4 

**Sample Output:**

    1 2 5 3 6 4


#### Binary Search Tree Reference 
In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value. 
All values on the right branch are greater than the node value.
